## Using wine sales data from Walgreens, we are seeking to accurately predict future wine sales using the following variables:
  - Previous annual sales at the "store level"
  - Footage allocated in each store to merchandise wine products
  
## In addition, we are seeking to uncover actionable and data-driven insights by using Tableau for efficient data exploration
